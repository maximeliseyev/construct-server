# fly.worker.toml app configuration file for Construct Delivery Worker
#
# This is a background worker that processes offline message delivery.
# It listens to Redis Pub/Sub for user online notifications and moves messages
# from offline queues to the appropriate server instance delivery queues.
#
# Deploy with: fly deploy --config fly.worker.toml
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
